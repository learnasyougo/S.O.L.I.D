## Single Responsability Principle
> A class should only have only one reason to change.

## Open/Closed Principle
> Software entities (e.g. classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
> In a computer program, if type *B* is a subtype of type *A* then objects of type *A* may be replaced with objects of type *B* without altering any of the desirable properties of type *A*. In essence it means that every subclass should be substitutable for their base class. 

## Interface Segregation Principle
> No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use, implicitely implying that a client should never be forced to implement an interface it doesn't use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details, details should depend on abstractions.
